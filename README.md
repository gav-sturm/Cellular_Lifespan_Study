# Cellular_Lifespan_Study
A repository of code for data analysis/processing generated for the Cellular Lifespan Study. 

[Study Overview](images/Fig1_sciData_lowres.pdf)

The study was performed at the Mitochondrial Psychiobiolgy Lab at Columbia University Medical Center. These data contains genome-wide, multimodal data collected at high temporal frequency across the replicative lifespan in cultured primary human fibroblasts.
