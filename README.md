# Cellular_Lifespan_Study
A repository of code for data analysis/processing generated for the Cellular Lifespan Study. The study was performed at the Mitochondrial Psychiobiolgy Lab at Columbia University Medical Center. These data contains genome-wide, multimodal data collected at high temporal frequency across the replicative lifespan in cultured primary human fibroblasts. For a more detailed explanation of the study design see: Sturm et al., Biorxiv 2021. All data can be accessed and browsed at our webtool: [https://columbia-picard.shinyapps.io/shinyapp-Lifespan_Study/](https://columbia-picard.shinyapps.io/shinyapp-Lifespan_Study/)
